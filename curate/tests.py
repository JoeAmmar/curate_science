            abstract='''
            Physical cleansing has been a focal element in religious ceremonies
            for thousands of years. The prevalence of this practice suggests a
            psychological association between bodily purity and moral purity.
            In three studies, we explored what we call the "Macbeth effect"-that is,
            a threat to one's moral purity induces the need to cleanse oneself.
            This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of
            cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products,
            and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes.
            Furthermore, we showed that physical cleansing alleviates the upsetting
            consequences of unethical behavior and reduces threats to one's moral self-image.
            Daily hygiene routines such as washing hands, as simple and benign as they might seem,
            can deliver a powerful antidote to threatened morality, enabling people to
            truly wash away their sins.
